Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing 
source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and 
you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be 
merged into one source
