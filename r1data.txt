Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single 
innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally 
cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or
team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to 
prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of 
compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core 
layered with tightly wound string.
