react native is cool language

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. 
So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX,
components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff,
like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not

it can run on both devices (android and IOS)

After learning about these terminologies, 
it will now be very easy for you to understand the difference 
between “git reset” and “git reset –hard” operations. As we already stated, 
there are multiple options that you can perform on a file that is uploaded on Git, similarly, 
“git reset” is defined as the default operation with which you can undo the last commit or 
change that you have made to the current file. Now, this operation comes with five different 
options, namely: hard, soft, merged, mixed, and keep.
