Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of Ten players on a 
field at the centre of which is a 20-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each 
end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the 
stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after 
it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball 
before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been 
dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, 
aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with 
two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.
