Depending upon the option that you have selected or used with your “git reset” command, you are going 
to get a different “undo” level. The “git reset –hard” operation is considered the most effective 
operation if you wish to entirely get rid of your last commit. It means that when you perform this 
operation, the head of your file will change, i.e., it will no longer be pointing to your last commit. 
Not only this, but it will also clear out your last commit from your index and even change your current 
working directory.
